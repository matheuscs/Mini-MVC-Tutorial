# MiniMVCTutorial

This project was developed based on a tutorial on Chapter #3 of the book "Head First: Servlets & JSP".

To work with this project is necessary to have JDK 7 or above, Eclipse IDE with Java EE plugin and an application server (eg. Tomcat).

It's a super simple example with source files properly segregated by package just like in big projects.

## Motivation

This sample project may work as an introductory example where people can see a highlight on how JSP & Servlets works, as well it can be a kick start for projects where the focus is to test some functionality.
